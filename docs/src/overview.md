# Overview
This is a simple project that allows tmux sessions to be switched, along with created and deleted from the same screen.
Fuzzy searching can be used for filtering the list of sessions, also it will allow a session to be created from the text that has been entered.

If the session name that's being created matches a user defined template then a session will be created based on that template see the configuration for more information.
